**Lingotto is the historic home of Fiat, and the original factory with its infamous rooftop test track still stands.**

Next to it is a conference centre, shopping centre and not one, but two NH hotels. That's something to bear in mind if you're travelling to this part of Turin, as there aren't many landmarks beyond the factory to keep you pointing in the right direction.

Assuming you do find the Lingotto Tech hotel, you'll find it's a hotel mixing very different styles elegantly in to one form. Converted from an old factory, the rooms have incredibly high ceilings and huge windows, making things very light indeed.

The decor is minimal, almost stark, with a little use of wood, metal chairs and a glass table. It all works together so well, but isn't what you'd describe as warm and cosy.

That large desk hints at how well the hotel could work for the business traveller, but it falls down on one critical point; the internet service is appalling. Getting a wi-fi signal of any sort is hit and miss and, assuming you do strike lucky, throughput speeds are reminiscent of the late 90s.

Perhaps they're encouraging you to get out and about, on to the rooftop jogging track. That's not my style, so I took in the bar instead. Located in an atrium a couple of stories up from the reception area, it's another slightly cold place and, on this night at least, with indifferent service.
There's a good room service menu though, although I'm still unsure what a 'Crazy Sandwich' really is. Crazy pricing perhaps? €16 certainly seems plenty.

Breakfast is your usual buffet affair, with plenty of European and American options to choose from. There's free flowing coffee too, which is handy after being up all night trying to download some data for a bit of work that needed doing.

It all feels like a hotel that exists to serve the needs of people attending local conferences or meetings. I can't imagine anybody has stayed more than three nights at the Lingotto Tech, and they'd be going stir crazy by then -- there's little to do in the surrounding area, but at least there's a nearby underground station.

Actually, I take that back. You can at least spend some time in Giovanni Agnelli's private art collection. This impressive gallery put together by Fiat's founder is complimentary for hotel guests.

The Italian's are revamping the entire area around Lingotto too, so perhaps it's an up and coming place that will be a pleasure to visit in the future. At the moment it's not too welcoming, and the NH hotel (at least this one, I didn't venture in to the Lingotto Congress hotel) is a little too clinical.

Rooms at the four-star NH Lingotto Tech start at around £110 a night. Breakfast and parking are included.
