**Getting through Lyon airport is easy; it's so small that you're off the plane and, in my case, in to a waiting car within about 15 minutes. Getting in to downtown Lyon, where the Sofitel Bellecour is located, sadly isn't quite so smooth.**

However, once you're there it's a lovely place to be. Undergoing refurbishment now, the lower floors have been updated but I was placed up high on the eighth floor. From here the views could have been spectacular, but round the back of the hotel where my room was is nothing but other similar buildings. If you're the kind of person to need a view, ask for a room facing the river.

The room itself was a good size for a French hotel and, despite the refurbishment going on elsewhere, wasn't looking at all tired. The decor was a bit more gloomy and sombre than you might wish for, but the quality was excellent.

However, an odd oversight was the absence of a desk. I often use Sofitel hotels for business trips, and the small table and stool that were available to use just aren't up to scratch. This was a personal trip though, so it didn't sully the stay.

Neither did the top floor bar. Here you get an excellent view of the river in a dark and almost sensual environment. Bar staff were attentive, with an innovative iPad-based menu system being used for drinks -- I guess that sorts out any language barriers! The drinks were excellent too, if a tad pricey.

I'm sure the restaurant was as good, but I didn't make use of it on this trip. The Les Trois Dômes brasserie has a Michelin star against its name, so should make for a pleasant place for a meal, while a less formal option is available at Le Silk restaurant.

There's also a spa available for guests but, again, time was against me, so I'll have to take Sofitel's word that it really does provide serenity.

Once the renovations have been completed, this will be an excellent hotel. It's still very good now, but moving the decor in to the 21st century won't be a bad thing.

It's also worth remembering that Le Club Accor members with Gold status will get an upgrade if available, as well as a welcome drink at the bar, making the hotel excellent value for a five-star stay.

> Rooms at the Sofitel Bellecour in Lyon start at around £115 a night over a winter weekend. A two-course dinner at Les Trois Dômes starts at around £60\.
